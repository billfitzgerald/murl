# MOAR URLs - MURL

MURL takes a list of URLs and maps their domains to any indentified adtech vendors. 

To use MURL, you need a .txt file with a list of urls or domains. If you are testing multiple sites or scenarios, split each site into a separate .txt file.

A common use case for MURL is to export all urls seen in a proxy capture or a pcap file, and then map those calls to the companies that own the domains.

MURL generates a report that lists out each tested site, with each company contacted during testing for each site. Any domains that were contacted but not mapped to an owner are listed at the end of the report. 

MURL will also export all URLs that have parameters in a single section. This can simplify searching for and finding sensitive or meaningful information exposed in urls.

## Quick start

1. Make sure the <code>source</code> and <code>results</code> directories exist. See **Usage details** below for more information. 
1. Create .txt files with the URLs you want to map. See **Naming your .txt files** below for more information.
2. Put the .txt files in the <code>source</code> directory.
3. Optional: adjust the output settings as needed. This isn't necessary, and the default settings are good for most cases. For more information, see **Adjust output preferences** below.

## Usage details

After cloning the repo, create two directories in the base: <code>source</code> and <code>results</code>.

You will place all source .txt files in the <code>source</code> directory, and all reports will be stored in the <code>results</code> directory. 

You can change these locations, but be sure to adjust the corresponding values in the python script.

## Naming your .txt files

* When creating the text files that store urls, your file name should contain the name of the domain you are testing. For example, if you are testing **nytimes.com**, your file name should be <code>nytimes_com.txt</code>. 
* Create a separate .txt file for each domain or scenario you are testing. Every individual file will have its own section in the report generated by MURL.
* In the .txt files, put one url on each line.
* Don't worry about long and ugly urls. They will be managed.

## Adjust output preferences

In most cases, this isn't needed, as the defaults work cleanly. However, if you want to fidget, three settings can be adjusted. These values can be set in the beginning of the <code>analyse_urls.py</code> file.

* <code>include_params</code> = "yes" # set as a yes/no value. Setting to "no" excludes all parameters from the report
* <code>params_separate_file</code> = "yes" # set to "yes" to only write paramaters to a separate file. This is a sane default
* <code>include_subdomains</code> = "yes" # set as a yes/no value. Setting to "no" excludes all subdomains from the report
